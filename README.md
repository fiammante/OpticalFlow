# OpticalFlow 
Creates an optical flow in a 3D view with time as depth using VTK Visualization Toolkit and Marching Cubes Algorithm.
Notebook renders to HTML using Plotly. I did not add the HTML to github as it is big (119 MB with the provided mp4).
Because of the size of the HTML it takes around 10 seconds to display on my laptop.
Source video used in the example is here https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/data/vtest.avi
